## Projects
### Customer Churn Prediction
[Churn Prediction](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VJySmmj3wHxRfs_6pzb5F0KYK1OD0wyC?usp=sharing)  
This project walks through a full machine learning pipeline using the Telecommunication dataset. It begins with data exploration and preprocessing, including handling missing values, converting data types, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Exploratory analysis reveals that customers with month-to-month contracts, higher monthly charges, or fiber optic internet are more likely to churn, while long-tenure customers and those with bundled services are more likely to stay. Various classification models like logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting are trained and evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, achieving strong performance. The notebook highlights the value of churn prediction in identifying high-risk customers and enabling businesses to take proactive retention measures.

### Time Series Forecasting
[Beijing Air Pollution Prediction](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hww8gPPFgfT0I5in6KNDrx-CK1eg-gDd?usp=sharing)  
It is a complete deep learning-based approach to time series forecasting using an LSTM model. The dataset is loaded and processed by converting the datetime column to a proper datetime index, handling missing values with forward fill, and ensuring the data is in a continuous time series format. It visualizes trends and seasonality in the data to better understand its structure. The values are normalized using MinMaxScaler to scale features between 0 and 1, which is critical for stable LSTM training. The data is then split into training and testing sets without shuffling, and a custom function is defined to convert the time series into supervised learning format by creating sequences of past values as input to predict the next value. An LSTM model is constructed using Keras Sequential API with LSTM and Dense layers, compiled with the mean_squared_error loss and adam optimizer. The model is trained using model.fit(), and predictions are made on the test set. The predicted results are compared visually and evaluated using mean_squared_error. Finally, the model is used for multi-step future forecasting by iteratively feeding back predicted values, showcasing the model's ability to forecast beyond the available data range.

### Bangla & English Image to Text
[Image to Text](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VJySmmj3wHxRfs_6pzb5F0KYK1OD0wyC?usp=sharing)

This project shows how to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on mixed Bengali and English text using pytesseract, a Python wrapper for Tesseract OCR. It guides through setting up Bengali language support by installing the ben.traineddata model, configuring Tesseract to recognize Bengali (lang='ben') as well as English, and processing sample book-page images. The workflow includes preprocessing steps like image cleaning and setting up the correct tessdata directory, followed by invoking pytesseract.image_to_string() to extract multilingual text from input images. It's an applied example of extending Tesseract’s default English OCR to handle Bengali script effectively.

### Web Scraping: Hourly Weather Data for Bangladesh
[Hourly Weather Data for Bangladesh](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TftZPDQ4bkrb4Ygg7ke1Bm56MPejJxTo?usp=sharing)  
This Colab notebook focuses on web scraping and data visualization related to electricity imports and fuel sources. It uses tools like requests and BeautifulSoup to extract data on electricity imports from neighboring countries such as India and Nepal, as well as the contributions of different fuel sources like gas, coal, hydro, and solar. After cleaning and organizing the data, the notebook visualizes trends over time using line and bar charts to highlight import volumes and the share of various energy sources. These visualizations provide insights into energy dependency patterns, seasonal shifts in fuel usage, and the role of each country in electricity imports.

## Projects
### Customer Churn Prediction
[Churn Prediction](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VJySmmj3wHxRfs_6pzb5F0KYK1OD0wyC?usp=sharing)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Machine Learning Algorithms Using Python
[Machine Learning Algorithms](https://www.kaggle.com/work/collections/16287124?privacy=public&owner=owns)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
